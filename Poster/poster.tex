	% General problem introduction
	\block{General Problem}
	{
		Performing diagnosis on a complex system requires at least an efficient
		and accurate model of the system itself, which can then be used to
		run simulations useful to collect data for diagnosis.
		The problem is that running simulations on such high fidelity models
		requires time and high performance resources, which cannot always be
		available.
		For this reason we want to generate a simple model of the complex system
		based only on real data, provided by the system itself, and then use it
		to perform our analysis.
		From such simple model we will be able to retrieve all information of
		the system requried to perform fault diagnosis on it.

	% Approach block
	\block{Approach}
	{
		Our goal is to create a framework able to create a diagnoser of the
		system under observation, only providing the data of its behaviour,
		either correct or faulty. \\

				\textbf{\textit{Model generation}}
			\end{center}
			The data driven model creation can be done using different
			approaches, from polynomial approaches to machine learning methods.
			The selection of the appropriate model to use will be done through
			an optimization problem based on \emph{Accuracy} and
			\emph{Computational Costs} of each model.
			$$ J(\cdot) = \alpha\ Accuracy(\cdot) + \beta\ Computational\ Cost(\cdot) $$

				\textbf{\textit{Diagnosis}}
			\end{center}
			In respect to the error classification and recognition, a Neural
			Network or a series of Support Vector Machines will be implemeted to
			deal with the errors in the system behaviour.

	% Achievements block
	\block{Achievements}
	{
		Currently we are able to generate a linear model from the data of a
		high-fidelity model.
		Such model, or \emph{Corrective model}, properly approximates the
		behaviour of the high-fidelity model in every scenario separatedly, will
		that either be a normal or faulty behaviour.  
		The purpose of this corrective model has been extended to a more general
		scenario and tries to generate the best model which can predict how to
		behave in each possible faulty situation.

	% Next steps block
	\block{Next steps}
	{
		We are now trying to incorporate some basic machine learning concepts to
		our framework for the model generation, which will lead us to find which
		model is best to be used for a particular problem.
